# Action Git Commits Since Release

This is git action that determines the commits since the last release

## Usage

By default, the action will try to run the provided tasks only on the affected
projects. This behavior can be modified using the different inputs (see below).

> workflow.yml

```yaml
---
- name: Checkout
  uses: actions/checkout@v5

- uses: dkhunt27/action-git-commits-since-release@v1
```

## Test your action locally

The [`@github/local-action`](https://github.com/github/local-action) utility can
be used to test your action locally. It is a simple command-line tool that
"stubs" (or simulates) the GitHub Actions Toolkit. This way, you can run your
TypeScript action locally without having to commit and push your changes to a
repository.

The `local-action` utility can be run in the following ways:

- Visual Studio Code Debugger

  Make sure to review and, if needed, update
  [`.vscode/launch.json`](./.vscode/launch.json)

- Terminal/Command Prompt

  ```bash
  # npx @github/local action <action-yaml-path> <entrypoint> <dotenv-file>
  npx @github/local-action . src/main.ts .env
  ```

You can provide a `.env` file to the `local-action` CLI to set environment
variables used by the GitHub Actions Toolkit. For example, setting inputs and
event payload data used by your action. For more information, see the example
file, [`.env.example`](./.env.example), and the
[GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#default-environment-variables).

## Publishing a New Release

This project includes a helper script, [`script/release`](./script/release)
designed to streamline the process of tagging and pushing new releases for
GitHub Actions.

GitHub Actions allows users to select a specific version of the action to use,
based on release tags. This script simplifies this process by performing the
following steps:

1. **Retrieving the latest release tag:** The script starts by fetching the most
   recent SemVer release tag of the current branch, by looking at the local data
   available in your repository.
1. **Prompting for a new release tag:** The user is then prompted to enter a new
   release tag. To assist with this, the script displays the tag retrieved in
   the previous step, and validates the format of the inputted tag (vX.X.X). The
   user is also reminded to update the version field in package.json.
1. **Tagging the new release:** The script then tags a new release and syncs the
   separate major tag (e.g. v1, v2) with the new release tag (e.g. v1.0.0,
   v2.1.2). When the user is creating a new major release, the script
   auto-detects this and creates a `releases/v#` branch for the previous major
   version.
1. **Pushing changes to remote:** Finally, the script pushes the necessary
   commits, tags and branches to the remote repository. From here, you will need
   to create a new release in GitHub so users can easily reference the new tags
   in their workflows.
